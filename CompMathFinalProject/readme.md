# Regression Final Project

This is one of the topic for final project in Computational Mathematic Course. The main aim is to create a regression line out of a given date with utmost precise through comparing the line from 3 different regression methods:

- Linear regression
- Exponential Regression
- Polynomial Regression

The program is made through python scripting language with 3 main modules, numpy, matplotlib, and decimal. There are a few things to achieve in this project:

- Reading data from csv file
- Calculates regression line
- Plot graph
- Find out the best fit by comparing the standard error
- ~~Write out the regression plot into csv file~~
- ~~Exporting graphs and data into pdf file~~
